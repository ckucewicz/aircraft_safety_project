# Business Understanding
## Background:
My company is planning to diversify its porfolio by extending to different 
markets. More specifically, my company is looking to invest in airplanes 
in order for their expansion to different markets to be successful.

## Business Goals:
This project is focusing on determining the risks of different aircrafts. 
Specifically, this project has the goal of identifying which aircrafts 
pose the least amount of potential risk. This information will be used in 
order to provide three recommendations to my company regarding the safest 
aircrafts to purchase.

## Business Success Criteria:
The success criteria for this project will be to provide three 
recommendations about the safest aircrafts that my company should invest 
in. For this project, the term "safest" refers to types of aircrafts with 
the least amount of crashes and the least number of casualties

# Data Understanding
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) collects data on aviation 
accidents and incidents that occur in the United States (which include its 
territories) as well as international waters. This dataset includes 31 features and 88,889 observations/entries.

Each entry in the dataset represents an aircraft involved in an accident 
(or incident). For each aircraft there is a unique ID associated with the 
specific accident (or incident) the aircraft was involved in. Additional 
information is included about each entry, such as the accident (or 
incident) date, location, and number of injuries, as well as 
characteristics about the aircraft, such as the make, model, and number of 
engines

# Exploratory Data Analysis

# Conclusion

## Limitations 

## Recommendations
This analysis leads to three recommendations for choosing the safest aircrafts:

* **Invest in aircraft that have more than two engines and are not classified as a reciprocating engine.** Aircraft with reciprocating engines are prone to more accidents (~90%). Similarly, aircraft with one or two engines were involved in ~98% of reported accidents.

* **Focus training of pilots on the Takeoff and Landing phases.** While there are many phases that pilots must master, accidents during the Takeoff and Landing phases account for almost one-third of all accidents (~31%).

* **Select aircraft made by one of the following companies: Hiller, Schweizer, Stinson, Maule, Enstrom, Luscombe, Aeronca, Air Tractor, Ayres.** Planes made by these aircraft manufacturers were found to hold the least amount of risk based on a combination of their non-fatal rate, deathes per flight, and overal number of deaths.
